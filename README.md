IPC144-S14
This is repo contains class examples for students in IPC144-section T  and O in Fall 2014 at Seneca College. You can view the examples in the browser, but you can also have a copy of it on your matrix account which will allow you to modify and play with the code.

To get the code contained here on your matrix account:

First time (do this only the first time).

Log onto matrix.
Go to the directory where you would like your code examples for this class to go (if you want it at top level, skip this step)
type: git clone https://github.com/elnazd/IPC144-F14.git
This will create a directory called IPC144-F14 in your current directory. Go into that for code updates

All other times (to update after class):

Log onto matrix.
go into the IPC144-F14 directory
type: git pull origin
